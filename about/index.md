Hi, my name is Jeremy Fairbank, and I am a software engineer. I enjoy working
with JavaScript and Elm, but I know my way around other languages like Ruby. I
like to build modular, component-driven applications with reasonable abstraction
to keep things DRY. I really enjoy helping and teaching others, especially about
JavaScript and Elm.

## Work

I work for [Sigient](http://sigient.com) as a full-stack engineer with a focus
on React, Redux, and functional programming.

## Conferences

I like to speak at web development conferences. You can see many of my talks by
