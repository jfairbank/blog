Hi, my name is Jeremy Fairbank, and I am a web developer. I enjoy working with Ruby and JavaScript, but I know my way around other languages. I work remotely on [SimplyBuilt](http://www.simplybuilt.com) for an awesome company called Push ([pushagency.io](http://pushagency.io)). I like to build modular, scalable applications with reasonable abstraction to keep things DRY.

## Non Work

Outside of work I am a husband to my beautiful wife and a father to my son. I play guitar and sing at my church and believe I would be pretty messed up without the grace of God every day. I dabble in some photography and really enjoy jazz and chill electronic music.

## Say Hello
