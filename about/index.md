Hi, my name is Jeremy Fairbank, and I am a web developer. I enjoy working with
JavaScript and Ruby, but I know my way around other languages.
I like to build modular, scalable applications with reasonable abstraction to keep things DRY. I really enjoy helping and teaching others, especially about JavaScript.

## Besides Dev

Outside of web development I am a husband to my beautiful wife and a father to
my son. I play guitar and sing at my church and believe I would be pretty
messed up without the grace of God every day. I dabble in some photography and
really enjoy jazz and chill electronic music.
