Hi, my name is Jeremy Fairbank, and I am a web developer. I enjoy working with
JavaScript and Ruby, but I know my way around other languages.
I like to build modular, scalable applications with reasonable abstraction to keep things DRY. I really enjoy helping and teaching others, especially about JavaScript.
