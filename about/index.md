Hi, my name is Jeremy Fairbank, and I am a web developer. I enjoy working with
JavaScript and Ruby, but I know my way around other languages.
I like to build modular, scalable applications with reasonable abstraction to keep things DRY. I really enjoy helping and teaching others, especially about JavaScript.

## Work

<a href="http://pushagency.io" class="push-logo" target="_blank"></a> <a href="http://www.simplybuilt.com" class="simplybuilt-logo" target="_blank"></a>

I work remotely on [SimplyBuilt](http://www.simplybuilt.com) for an awesome
company called Push ([pushagency.io](http://pushagency.io)).

## Conferences

<h3>Nodevember '14<br><small>Building Modular and Component Driven Architecture in Backbone.js and Marionette.js</small></h3>

I had the amazing honor to give my first developer talk at the inaugural
<a href="http://www.nodevember.org/" target="_blank">Nodevember</a> conference
in Nashville.

## Besides Dev

Outside of web development I am a husband to my beautiful wife and a father to
my son. I play guitar and sing at my church and believe I would be pretty
messed up without the grace of God every day. I dabble in some photography and
really enjoy jazz and chill electronic music.
