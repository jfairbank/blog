Hi, my name is Jeremy Fairbank. I am a software developer with a primary focus on the web. I really like Ruby and JavaScript, but I know my way around many other languages too. I work for a manufacturing company as the IT manager and sole developer. I like to build modular, scaleable applications with plenty of abstraction to keep things DRY.

## Non Work

Outside of work I am a husband to my beautiful wife, and I am a father-to-be. I play guitar and sing at my church and believe I would be pretty messed up without the grace of God every day. I dabble in some photography and really enjoy jazz and chill electronic music.
