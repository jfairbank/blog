Functional programming may seem like a buzzword or fad, but there are good reasons why
so many companies and frameworks are hopping on board these days, \*cough\*
Facebook \*cough\*. Functional programming has been around for a long time now
actually and shows no signs of stopping. It is simply elegant at times, naturally
expressing problems and their solutions in terms of *what* instead of *how*.

Thankfully, JavaScript is already capable of equipping programmers with powerful
functional programming constructs. So, I would like to take some time to go
through a short post series on functional programming (FP). In this first post,
I will go over the classic case study of the power of FP, the list. We will
discover the beauty of building and iterating lists through two keystone
FP concepts, recursion and immutability.

## Recursion and Immutability

In case you are unfamiliar with recursion and immutability, we will expound
upon them for a minute.

According to {% ext_link http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion Wikipedia %}:
"*Recursion is the process of repeating items in a self-similar way.*"

In terms of FP, this is the action of a function calling itself a number of times.
OKâ€¦ but what does that accomplish? Well, one classic example is implementing
a function to calculate the value of the Fibonacci sequence at a given number `n`:

{% gist 4cdab1438cd8b66ef090/fib.js %}

Notice that we call our `fib` function inside itself for inputs `n > 1`. We return
the result of `fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2)` to get the final answer. If we were to
trace calls to `fib` for `n = 4`, we would see something like this:

{% gist 4cdab1438cd8b66ef090/fib-calls.js %}

Notice something interesting? At the next to last line, all that is left is addition
with `1's` and `0's` to yield `3`. This is the power of recursion, **the base case**.

Think of recursion in terms of a tree. At the root of our tree is the base case(s).
For `fib`, our base cases are `1` and `0`, so they comprise the root of the tree.
From the root, the tree grows out into branches and leaves. Those leaves are
our values for `n > 1`. We cannot have the leaves without the root, so we cannot
have these answers without our base cases.

Imagine if we wanted to traverse the life source of that leaf. We would start at
the leaf, working our way down the branches and trunk step-by-step to finally
arrive at the root. That is like our growing call stack with recursive calls to
finally get to something that returns an actual value, `1` or `0`. Then,
everything cascades back up to give us our final value, which is `3` in the case
of `n = 4`.

Now compare this to an imperative approach with dynamic programming:

{% gist 4cdab1438cd8b66ef090/fib-imperative.js %}

That is a little less understandable, albeit **FAAAARRR** more performant. If we
compare the imperative approach with the functional approach, we find that the
functional approach more naturally expresses the recurrence relation of the Fibonacci 
sequence, $$F_n = F_{n - 1} + F_{n - 2}$$, where $$F_0 = 0$$ and $$F_1 = 1$$.
The recurrence relation is in the imperative approach too, but we have to look
a little harder.

That briefly covers recursion, but what about immutability? Let us compare the
two implementations of our `fib` function again. You will notice that our imperative
approach modifies the value of several variables multiple times. We increment
`i` and reassign values to `ans`, `n0`, and `n1`. Our functional approach
never reassigns values to anything. In fact, the only variable in our functional
implementation is our one `n` parameter, and we never change it.

When we do not change the values of our state (i.e. our variables), we are enforcing
immutability. The converse, mutability, is when we mutate state (i.e. change the value of
variables). Immutability is a key tenet of FP. It allows us to think of our functions
in simpler terms: single input, single output, no side effects. This can help us produce
fewer bugs (take that with a grain of salt) and make testing easier.

## The List

With that introduction to recursion and immutability behind us, we can now focus
on our task of building the functional list.

So, what is a list? I am sure most of you are already familiar with the concept
of linked lists, and this is not very different. We will have a head, the first
item in a list, and a tail, the remaining items in the list. Typically, we use
some data structure that wraps the actual value and has a pointer or reference
to the next item in the list. We know we are at the end of the list when the last
item points to some null reference.

Imagine we have a linked list of integers.  We would typically view it like so:

![Linked List](/images/functional-javascript-lists-1/linked-list.png)

Functional lists are pretty much the same thing, but we adopt some different
conventions when referring to them. Typically, we refer to our wrapping data structure
as a "cons cell". There are built-in operators and functions in functional
languages to build a cons cell. The cons operation takes two arguments, a head
and a tail. The head is the actual underlying value and the tail is the reference
to the next cons cell.

The final item in the list will have a tail that points to nil, or the empty list.
This is the null value at the end of the linked list. It is that final nil reference
that really makes the top level cons cell a "list."

Now, when it comes to functional lists, I like to picture them differently. I like
to view each item's tail as a literal tail of the remaining items instead of just
a reference to the next item. I like to imagine a recursive (there is
that word again) data structure of cons cells wrapping other cons cells until we
get to the final empty list. Treating this as a recursive data structure is
hugely powerful! Just look below; you may even see why that tree analogy is so
important.

![Functional List](/images/functional-javascript-lists-1/functional-list.png)

When we think back to our tree analogy, this illustration suggests something
powerful about lists as recursive data structures. Notice the similarities
with our Fibonacci function call stack. We now think of our list in terms of what
it is built up from: the empty list.

With this revelation, we can begin to implement functions to operate on our list.
We will look at two classic functions, `map` and `reduce`, and create our own recursive
implementations of them for our list.

## Implementing the List

First, we need to create our list data structure. To accomplish this, we actually
need to implement the cons cell and nil, the empty list.

{% gist 4cdab1438cd8b66ef090/cons-1.js %}

{% gist 4cdab1438cd8b66ef090/nil-1.js %}

So, `Cons` has a `head` property, a `tail` property, and `isEmpty = false`.
Notice that `Nil` is an object literal instead of a constructor function. It
does not make sense to make multiple instances of `Nil` when it always represents
the empty list. This is no different than the null value in programming languages.
Also notice that since `Nil` is the empty list, `isEmpty = true`, and we throw
errors if you try to access `head` or `tail` on it.

So, if we wanted to build a list, we could do this then:

{% gist 4cdab1438cd8b66ef090/build-list-1.js %}

That is unsightly, though. We should at least introduce a helper function to
clean it up a little:

{% gist 4cdab1438cd8b66ef090/build-list-2.js %}

That is better; we will create an even nicer-looking function later on, but we will
use this for now.

## Implementing Map and Reduce

Now we are ready to create our own implementations of `map` and `reduce`. If you
are unfamiliar with these functions, I encourage you to check out the examples at
the Mozilla developer website for JavaScript arrays:
{% ext_link https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map map %}
and
{% ext_link https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/Reduce reduce %}.

Briefly, `map` takes a list, applies some transformation function to each item,
and returns a new list of those transformed items. `reduce` takes a list and
transforms the list (reduces the list) to some other value by applying the
transformation function to each item in the list.

We will implement these functions in two manners, first as regular functions and
then as methods of our `Cons` and `Nil` objects. First, let us look at `map`.

### Map

{% gist 4cdab1438cd8b66ef090/map.js %}

So what is going on here? Just like our functional `fib` implementation and with
almost any FP function, we need a base case. Remember that this is the root from
which we build our result. In this instance, our base case is `Nil`. We check
that via the `isEmpty` property. If it is true, then we just return `list`
(we could return `Nil` here too since they are the same object).

Now let us dissect the meat of this function at line 6. This is a `map` function,
so we have to apply the supplied function argument `fn` to each value. We do that
by calling `fn(list.head)`. Because we need to apply the function to every item,
we then recursively call `map` with the remaining items, which are referenced by
`list.tail`. Therefore, we call `map(list.tail, fn)`. Finally, we wrap those two
calls in `cons`, returning `cons(fn(list.head), map(list.tail, fn))`. Notice
anything else? We are returning a new cons cell. We never modified our original list,
so we are upholding immutability too.

If we follow the recursive calls, we will see our call stack keep growing until
we finally get to `Nil`. Once we return it, we can begin to return the result
for each remaining frame in the stack until the first call returns the new list.
Here is how the list will get built with each call below:

{% gist 4cdab1438cd8b66ef090/map-call-1.js %}

There is our first implementation of `map`. But what if we wanted to utilize JavaScript's
object-oriented capabilities and eliminate that `isEmpty` conditional check? In
this case we need to add `map` as a method to the `Cons` prototype and to
the `Nil` object.

{% gist 4cdab1438cd8b66ef090/oop-map.js %}

Basically what we have done is separate out the branches of computation in `map`
to the objects with which they are concerned. `Cons#map` builds up the new cons cells
and `Nil` just returns itself. Notice we also changed `map(this.tail, fn)` to
`this.tail.map(fn)`. I think this looks a little nicer than the strict function
implementation. In most functional programming languages, we do not have this
affordance, so they utilize some rather elegant pattern matching control structures
that are similar to switch statements but vastly more powerful.

Our usage would only change in how we initially call `map`:

{% gist 4cdab1438cd8b66ef090/map-call-2.js %}

So that is `map`. See how elegantly and simply we were able to implement it in just
a couple lines. An imperative approach would require some looping construct
and constantly reassigning values to create a new list, which means more code
that may be harder to reason about (some people may find looping more
intuitive, so I do not want to discredit them).

### Reduce

Next up is `reduce`. Recall that with `reduce` we want to transform our list into
some other value and that may not be another list. Here is the function
implementation:

{% gist 4cdab1438cd8b66ef090/reduce.js %}

This is very similar to our `map` implementation. Notice that we have one more
input this time, `memo`. Think of this as an accumulator, so we can keep track
of the value that we are building from our list. Also notice that `memo` will
serve as the value for our base case, the empty list. This is where we check
`isEmpty` again.

If our list is not empty, then we of course make a recursive call to `reduce`,
passing in the `tail`, the same transformation function `fn`, and the recalculated
memo value `fn(memo, list.head)`. The combination of recursive calls and calculating
new `memo` values is what allows us to transform the entire list into something
else.

Here is a great example where we can calculate the sum of a list of numbers:

{% gist 4cdab1438cd8b66ef090/reduce-call-1.js %}

And of course, let us simplify our implementation with the object-oriented
approach:

{% gist 4cdab1438cd8b66ef090/oop-reduce.js %}

If you are familiar with `reduce`, then you also know we could alter our
implementation to not require the initial `memo` argument. Instead we could make
it optional, and use the first `head` as the initial `memo` if none is supplied.

Now you might notice something. Is not `map` just a special case of `reduce`?
Yes! In fact we can implement `map` in terms of `reduce's` cousin `reduceRight`.
`reduceRight` is just like `reduce` except it reduces the list items in the
reverse direction. So, it would first encounter `Nil`, then the next-to-last
item, and keep going until it reaches the first item in the list. `reduceRight`
can be implemented as follows:

{% gist 4cdab1438cd8b66ef090/oop-reduceRight.js %}

This is very close to the implementation of `reduce` except we flip the order in
which we call our transformation function and when we make our recursive calls.
This ensures that the transformation function first gets called with `Nil`. This
is crucial if we want to implement `map` in terms of `reduceRight`. If we used
`reduce` instead, we would indeed map over our values, but build our new list in
the reverse direction.

Our new map implementation can be seen below:

{% gist 4cdab1438cd8b66ef090/oop-map-reduce.js %}

Since we are reducing from the right, we will start from `Nil` and build cons
cells up from that. Think back to our list picture where we stacked the cons cells
like a tree. Picture `reduceRight` and our new `map` implementation as stacking
those cons cells from the bottom up.

## Wrapping It Up

I hope this gives you an idea of the power of expressiveness inherent in functional
programming. With very little code, we built an iterable list and two
famous functions to operate on that list.

However, please keep in mind that these are very basic implementations  and are
not optimized for performance. You will also run into issues if you try to iterate
over very large lists. Because we depend on recursion, our call stack
could grow very large and lead to the infamous stack overflow. One way around
this is to utilize tail call optimization, a feature which is slated for ES6.
(Essentially, if you tailor the last statement in your function correctly, you
can ensure that recursive calls do not add to the call stack but instead just
replace the current stack frame with a new one.)

One more thing. I mentioned there was a way we could simplify list construction
to avoid several `cons` calls. We can implement a `list` function that takes
a variable number of arguments and produces a list. Since we are talking about
FP, let us implement that function in a functional manner too.

{% gist 4cdab1438cd8b66ef090/list-constructor.js %}

So notice here we are mirroring the concepts we used in our list functions. We
are returning `Nil` if `arguments` are empty, so this is our base case. We then
get the `head` and `tail` from `arguments` and pass them along to a `cons` call.
Inside that `cons` call we recursively apply the `list` function to the tail via
`list.apply(null, tail)`.

Then, we can use our `list` function for easier list construction:

{% gist 4cdab1438cd8b66ef090/list-calls.js %}

Thanks for reading and please leave any feedback or questions you may have on
FP and lists. If you feel there are any holes in this explanation, please let me
know. I hope you now have a better understanding and appreciation for
what is possible with functional programming. We will continue to investigate
the concepts of functional programming in future posts.
